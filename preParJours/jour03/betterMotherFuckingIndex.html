      <p class='paraP'>
        That's how much CSS it took to turn that
        <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
        into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it
        <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect ass website:
      </p>
        <ul class='paraP'>
          <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
          <li><em>still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
          <li><em>still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
          <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole
            that visits your site</li>
          <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
        </ul>
      <h3 class='title'>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        <p class='paraP'>
          You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
          Here's how.
        </p>

      <h2 class='title'>Let it breathe</h2>
        <p class='paraP'>
          Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.
            Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping.
          The default are trash -- pick a minimum line height : 1.4 for
          body copy.
          Headings should be tighter. if you can't see that...piss off.
            <br>
          If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever.
          You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
        </p>
      <h2 class='title'>a little less contrast</h2>
        <p class='paraP'>
          Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?
          Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's
          background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on
          keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
        </p>
      <h3 class='title'>Size matters</h2>
        <p class='paraP'>
          I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body
          copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for
          print, not the screen.
        </p>
      <h2 class='title'>Line-width,motherfucker</h2>
        <p class='paraP'>
          Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a
          line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice
          60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your
          worthless dribble.
        </p>
      <h3 class='title'>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        <p class='paraP'>
          I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">
          this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so
          simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default,
          they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also
           fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to
           make them not total shit.
